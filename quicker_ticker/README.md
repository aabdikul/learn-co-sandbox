# QuickerTicker

Welcome to QuickerTicker! QuickerTicker lets you pull data such as a stock's price, name, beta, yield, dividend, and open price, from your terminal.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'quicker_ticker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install quicker_ticker

## Usage

Upon running QuickerTicker, the user will be able to enter in an NYSE or NASDAQ stock ticker symbol. Upon, entering a stock ticker, the user will then be asked what data values they would like to see. 

The user can specify one of the following values: "price", "name", "beta", "open", "dividend", or "yield". Upon hitting "Enter", the user will find the value that they are searching for. 

To exit the program, a user must type "Exit".

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
